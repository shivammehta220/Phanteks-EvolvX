# Phanteks Evolv X Water-Cooled PC

This repository contains information and documentation for a water-cooled PC project that was undertaken a few years ago. The aim of this project was to enhance the cooling efficiency and reduce noise levels of the PC by implementing a water-cooling system. In addition to water-cooling, other upgrades were made to improve aesthetics. The project involved various components and customizations, as detailed below.

## Introduction

Water-cooling offers the advantage of more efficient heat dissipation compared to traditional air cooling methods and allowed for reduced noise levels. The main centre piece of the build is Phanteks Evolv X case, which has great aesthetics and plenty of room for all the water-cooling components.

## [Water Cooling Components](/assets/watercooling)

The water-cooling system was designed to cool three main components: the CPU, motherboard, and GPU. Water blocks from EK were utilized to replace the previous coolers and heatsinks on these components, ensuring efficient heat transfer.

## [Radiator Setup](/assets/watercooling)

To dissipate the heat generated by the system, two 360mm radiators were installedâ€”one positioned at the top of the case and the other at the front. The radiators, along with directly mounted fans, play a crucial role in heat dissipation. Additionally, M4 threads were tapped.

## [Pump/Reservoir Combo](/assets/watercooling)

A pump/reservoir combo unit, specifically the HEATKILLER 200 D5, was mounted inside the case to facilitate water circulation within the system. The proximity of the reservoir to the radiator's inlet necessitated the use of various fittings for proper integration. At the lower section of the combo, a T-fitting with a valve was added for easy draining.

## [Fittings and Tubing](/assets/watercooling)

All fittings utilized in the project were Bitspower Black Sparkle fittings, and 12mm Acrylic tubing was employed. The tubing runs were carefully planned to keep them clean and as short as possible, ensuring an organized and visually appealing build.

## [Coolant and Fill Process](/assets/watercooling)

For the coolant, distilled water was used in combination with Mayhems UV blue concentrate. During the filling and cycling process, paper towels were placed for protection. The system was carefully filled and checked to maintain optimal coolant levels (without powered on).

## [Custom Cable Sleeving](/assets/sleeving)

In addition to the water-cooling setup, custom wire and sleeve modifications were made to all the cables in the PC. The primary objective of this customization was to enhance the aesthetics of the build. Cables for the motherboard, CPU, and GPU were made with custom lengths using 16awg wire to minimize excess cables. Each wire is then crimped and placed in its connector. Other cables were left at their original lengths, either due to constraints imposed by connectors or other limitations.

Please note that not all sleeved cables have accompanying photos, as the sleeving process is time-consuming and exhaustive. However, the effort invested in custom cable sleeving greatly enhances the overall appearance of the build.
